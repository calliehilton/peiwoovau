Hey guys, I've been using Solus for a bit here and I have found it to be very stable on my system in every way except one, I have issues with wake from suspend, with issues getting worse the longer it's suspended. Here's some of hopefully relevant info. Model: Dell XPS 15 (9550) Non-touch Processor: Intel Core i5-6300HQ GPU: Nvidia GTX 960M Memory: 4GBx2 2133 DDR4 Running from a 500GB 5400rpm HDD GNOME: 3.28.2 Solus 3.9999 amp#x200B; My issues are mostly crashes after attempt. 
спасибо вам, хорошая статья, на нетбуке hdd password был неизвестен, прога wgen-samsung сгенерила пароль по выдаваемой ошибке, в точности как описано в данной статье. Hello, So recently I've been having all kinds of issues with my PC. I used to have this same issue while playing Rainbow 6, where the game would consistently crash and freeze my PC. After I got a new CPU and motherboard it solved this issue. About a year on I still have the same components (apart from a new PSU which is about 2 months old). About a week ago I started getting these crashes again in Rainbow 6 and my mate came round and did a bios update and limited bios не обнаруживает или не распознает жесткий диск ata/sata. Существует шесть основных причин, из-за которых bios системы может не обнаруживать наличие внутреннего жесткого диска. Hey guys, So I woke up today and everything seemed alright, played some, went to work. Got back home and instead of going in Sleep mode, my PC had frozen in the desktop. (my mouse and the entire thing were frozen.) I restarted the computer, only this time it froze on start up, so I had to manually turn it off, then on. The PC wouldn’t post then. Many times it went to a solid green screen. It loads up to the Windows password screen, then automatically restarts to the BIOS screen · 1. Настройка пользовательского пароля (Set User Password) 2.

I bought a server of ebay and it came with 2 WD Red inside. Trying to format or mount them would result in an IO error, although the smart data seemed fine. I plugged them into my main PC and got a password prompt (https://imgur.com/a/xEq6vOD). hdparm output confirms, that the HDDs have been locked down at the SATA level:  Security: Master password revision code = 65534 supported enabled gtgtgtgtgtgt locked ltltltltltltltltltl. So here we go. First I have to say it is my fault, I didn’t do enough research or take my time on it. Here goes they story and situation. -Original Xbox 1.0 is soft modded with UnleashX (2.38?) -I want to upgrade the HDD to install games to it. -Buys an unverified (not even lockable) hard drive as an upgrade. -Trying to do the upgrade thing with CHIMP. -Unlocks primary Original HDD, not really knowing what it does. -Knowing the hard drive upgrade didn’t work anyway, I try to boot with original. Hey everyone, this is an issue I could not fix myself, and it is driving me nuts. hopefully someone knows a fix. Okay, here it goes. My PC worked for years. Then finally, when it was getting too slow I started overclocking it. Nothing extreme, just up to 4.5ghz with a bit of voltage increase. temps were always in the green. I then started to have problems. Some were related to overclocking, other to specific bios settings that I had to change as long as my cpu was overclocked. I thought. 
Hi! Happy if this guide helps you. Tip if you want: 19656Uwdwko5RjtnuwQENpjBwE3ChzD59v ------------------------- UPDATE 04/06/17 Add 'uacomment=UASF-SegWit-BIP148' into your bitcoin.conf if you want to signal UASF. UPDATE 03/13/17 ADDED a tl;dr; Version at the end of this Post. UPDATE 03/12/17: Just to test it - I reinstalled all on 8GB SD and it works as well. But maybe you should use at least 16GB for the beginning. Using a 128GB card for the first version was a little bit stupid. Hi, xboxhdm is availiable only for Windows, but since it mostly just wraps some common Linux tools, I thought I could do well without Windows.

I was getting around. https://imgur.com/a/Kbzfb I just received and installed my new 3TB HDD. You'll see that in the Toshiba diagnostic tool that my new HDD's status is "Frozen"? I googled some solutions and all seemed to be pointing toward some sort of password. Thing is, the damn thing is brand new from Amazon, pulled from the box, original seals completely intact. BIOS detects the HDD, and obviously this program does as well, but Windows does not list it in my available drives. Any ideas. 
Hey, so I've just upgraded my PC pretty heavily. I installed a new motherboard (ASUS to ASUS ROG), CPU (FX to Ryzen), and RAM (Corsair to G.Skill). Using the same old HDD and SSD, Cooling (H100i GTX), PSU (CX750), GPU (EVGA GeForce GTX 650 Ti Boost), etc. I'm having an issue where not only do my mouse and keyboard stop working, but all USB ports stop working right before the Windows 7 login screen Upon starting up the computer, the keyboard and mouse work fine, and my USB microphone lights. Hey everyone I am hoping you can help me out. Over the past few months I have been saving all my money to buy the parts for a new beast of a computer. After the absolute and utter disgrace that was my last computer, cough cough alienware cough cough , I decided to go for a custom build. Yesterday the final part came in, and I built it. It works and hums absolutely beautifully. One thing I had stressed when building it was having an SSD for running the OS, and an additional hard drive. Using Flint OS for PC v1.1 Vanilla from USB or installed on HDD unable to log in. System boot as normal, entering email, password, I got an email notification about login attempt and submitted "That's me", and the system is stuck on "Please wait" (rotating circle), system is not frozen and I can switch to the console Ctrl+Alt+F2 but no mater how long I wait it won't go further. Hardware used: Lenovo Think Centre, CPU Celeron E1200 1,6GHz, RAM 1024Mb PC38500, Video Intel Eaglelake Graphics Ive tried for some time unlocking my old HDD. I should mention, i dont know shit about linux and commands, only that, what ive learned about hdparm, but im not complete idiot with computers. Tried google, but cant seem to find good answer. Anyway. my password is no secret, cause i never used it anywhere but on hdd(and old runescape account, which is banned) so im gonna copy some things here. First.after checking my hdd - sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdc Important part only - Security: Master. Okay so recently, i got a virus on my pc. multiple viruses actually. however i got hitman pro, malware bytes, antiadware , and microsoft's malware removal tool to remove the viruses and such. i thought that was the end of that. however, today i wasn't doing anything and i apparently had a virus when i scanned with the programs listed earlier. and keep in mind, my pc was running fine, i didn't notice anything weird about it and wouldn't have probably known there was a virus unless i scanned. My SSD seems to be locked at a specific state and I can't make any permanent changes to any files. Superficially, everything seems to be working just fine. Probable cause: The SSD is full. I know, this is bad, but this happened right when things went to shit so they're probably related. I let Google Drive sync to the wrong drive. I meant to choose my external, but synced it to C:, my SSD is only 240 GB and it just filled it to the brim with no warnings or anything. What's going
